# Netflix-Power-BI-Dashboard-
I recently built a Power BI Dashboard to analyze Netflix's vast content library, uncovering key insights such as:
1. Total Content: 8,807 shows and movies 📺
 2. Movies vs. TV Shows: 69.62% are movies, while 30.38% are TV shows 🎬
 3. Most Common Ratings: TV-MA, TV-14, and TV-PG dominate the platform!
 4. Popular Genres: Dramas, Documentaries, and Comedies lead the way!
 5. Content Growth Over Time: A clear trend in Netflix's expanding catalog.
This dashboard provides a data-driven view of Netflix’s content landscape, helping to understand trends and user preferences.
💡 Built Using: Power BI | DAX | Data Visualization
